        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Balance is about being truly healthy in body, mind and soul. It is about the way we live, how we view ourselves and our lives, what food we put into our body, and how much we move our body during the day. There are four main things that affect the body and our health: sleep, stress, movement, and food; and all four effect each other. Without addressing all aspects of health, it is impossible to be truly healthy.</font>

        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
            Health is about far more than a number on a scale. In fact, being truly healthy relies on many things. By making the only outcome of success weight loss and reaching a weight goal, most people miss the facts on being truly healthy.</font>

            Having enough high quality sleep is essential for health. In fact, it is so essential, that not enough sleep can eventually shorten our lives and decrease our quality of life. The long term consequences of not getting enough high quality sleep add up. Not getting enough sleep decreases our immune system and doesn't give our brain time to process what we have gone through during the day. Sleep also helps regulate our appetite, too little sleep increases our desire to eat. Chronic sleep deprivation has also been linked to increased risk of many chronic diseases, including diabetes.</font>

            Every minute of moving counts. If you're currently sitting most of the day and are overwhelmned by starting an exercise routine, start small. Aim for just 1 minute of walking a day. Doesn't sound like much, but it's one more than you've been doing. Find a starting goal that works for you. By setting realistic goals, and focusing on moving throughout the day, instead of just "working out," you help make yourself healthier. While working out can be very helpful, just moving once during the day isn't enough to make up for sitting the rest of the day. You don't need to "work out" to be healthy, you just need to move.</font>

            Many people have known for a long time that our mental health is just as important as our physical health. In fact, they both affect each other. Science has shown that health really is about mind, body and soul. Take time to focus on your mental well-being, whether it's practicing stress-reduction techniques, re-organizing your priorities, or finding ways to reduce stressful situations in your life, it matters.</font>

            Humans are used to eating real food and real animals. We were designed to eat food that comes from the ground, a plant, a tree. We were made to eat animals that lived off the land. The farther we get away from real food, the farther we get away from health. The best way to make sure we are getting everything we need, and not to much of what we don't, is to choose real foods. Try and eat as few processed foods as possible, even those being labeled as "healthy." Aim for choosing foods that are in season, this helps increase the variety of food you're eating. Try and get to know your farmers. Check out farmer's markets in your area. See a food you've never seen before? Not sure how to cook it? Just ask the farmer. They are a great resource to learn about new foods and get some really good recipes. </font>
