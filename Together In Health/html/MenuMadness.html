        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">If you've been to any chain restaurant lately, you might have noticed a lot more numbers next to your food options. Most restaurants are now required to post nutrition information about their foods right on the menus. But does this information really make a difference in health? Studies are showing that giving consumers this information isn't having the hoped for results - people choosing the "healthier" options are the ones that tend to choose healthier foods anyway.</font>

            <font color="3F3F3F">What you can do</font></font>
        
        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4"> 1. If you're going out only every once and awhile and use it as a treat, go ahead and enjoy. Having a splurge meal every once and awhile is just fine.
            
            <p>2. If you're eating out more than every once and awhile: stick to the under 500 calorie (ideally under 400) or "heart-healthy" menu items and get a vegetable side-dish if it doesn't come with one. Most meals, even the "healthy" ones, don't include many vegetables.</p>
            
            <p>3. Share a menu item with a friend. Choose an additional vegetable side dish so you both can have a balanced meal.</p>
            
            <p>4. Focus on making your other meals on the days you eat out healthy. That way you make sure you have an overall healthy and balanced day.</p></font>
