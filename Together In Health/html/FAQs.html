        <br><font color="3F3F3F">How come I can't track specific foods?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Tracking food by the way your plate looks helps to track how balanced meals and days are. Remember, not every meal needs to be perfect, the goal is to focus on doing your best. If you go back for seconds, or thirds, at a meal, add another plate to your meal. This helps you see how many times you go for seconds and thirds, and what kinds of food you're choosing when you do. It's ok to go back for more when you're still physically hungry, try and include a good serving of vegetables and some protein to help keep you full longer. Want to work on eating more vegetables? Look for more green. Not sure if you’re including enough protein in your diet? Look for the red. Interested to see how many carbs you eat? Check out how much yellow you have in a day. Use the colors to help you see patterns in your meals and day, and keep tracking your meals to help you keep up with changes you have made.</font>

        <font color="3F3F3F">Why should I track my water intake?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        We all know water is important, but it can be hard to know how much we're drinking during the day. Add either a cup at a time, or choose the number of total cups at the end of the day. Staying well hydrated is important for a lot of different reasons. One important reason is to help control how much we eat. Many of the times we think we're hungry our body is actually trying to tell us that we're thirsty. Try a glass of water after a meal if you're still hungry, you're body may be telling you it's still thirsty.</font>

        <font color="3F3F3F">Why doesn't it show me how many calories I've burned for each activity?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        Everyone is different, and calories burned for any activity or movement depends on a number of different factors. When we just focus on burning calories, we often miss the importance of the simple act of just moving. Moving throughout the day is really important. In fact, studies have shown that moving throughout the entire day is better for the body than being active for the same amount of time at just one time. You don’t have to break a sweat to get healthy. Find ways to increase your movement during the day in easy ways. Look at the examples below for some ideas. Track every activity you do to see how every little bit counts and adds up. If you're feeling overwhelmned by starting an "exericse routine," just think about it as simply moving a little extra every day. You don't need a high-intensity workout routine to get healthy, you just need to find activities and movements that you enjoy and that work for you. Make sure you like most of the activities you're doing (it can take some time to get to like an activity, so give it some time), otherwise it's hard to keep it up. The best activity is the activity you like to do.</font>

        <font color="3F3F3F">Ideas to get moving</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
            <li>Do wall sits while brushing your teeth. Start small. Since we should be brushing our teeth for 2 minutes, twice a day, that could add up to at total of 4 minutes a day. That doesn’t sound like much, but if you haven't done wall sits in awhile, it will definitely burn.</li><br>
            <li>Park in the farthest away spot when you run errands. An extra few minutes each way does add up.</li><br>
            <li>Come up with an easy workout you can do at work. There are lots of exercises that don't require any equipment or weights. Be careful to not do anything you can't safely do.'</li><br>
            <li>Take time to get up and walk every hour. It doesn't matter where you go, as long as you're moving.</li><br>
            <li>Take the long way to the bathroom or to get water. Say you have to go an extra 200 steps to the farther away bathroom or to get water, and you're doing both a total of 5 times in a work day, that's an extra 1,000 steps you just took that day.</li><br>
            <li>Go for a walk after lunch. If you're not used to walking, start small, even if it's just a walk around the parking lot, that's more movement than just sitting. Try including your coworkers to help you stay accountable.<li><br>
            <li>Try a sit/stand desk at work. Remember that moderation is important, too much sitting or standing can be dangerous.</li><br>
            <li>Try sitting on an exercise ball at work or at home while you're watching tv. Make sure you can safely balance. If you have problems with balance, try putting the exercise ball in a corner, this helps build up strength and work on balance, without risking falling backwards.</li><br>
            <li>Stretch for a few minutes before bed. It helps work out the kinks from the day and helps you de-stress, which can lead to better sleep. Flexibility is among the top things we should have as we get older, and it's never too early or late to start improving our flexibility.</li><br>
            <li>Simply walk in place. If it’s bad weather to walk outside and you don’t have access to indoor walking, simply walk in place. It may seem like you're going nowhere, but you can still get your heart-rate up.</li><br>
            <li>Take the stairs instead of the elevator or escalator. We here this all the time, but how many of us do it? If you work on a top floor in a building, going from the elevator to all those flights of stairs can seem rather daunting. Instead of thinking about it as "all or nothing," simply start with one flight of stairs at a time. For example, if you work on the 6th floor, start by getting off on the 5th floor every day for a week, the next week (or when you feel ready), get off on the 4th floor. Keep it up until you're walking all the way up to the 6th floor.</li><br>
            <li>If you're watching tv, get up and move during the commercials (even if you've recorded the show). Take a trip up and down the stairs, do some sit-ups or push-ups, dance, anything that gets you moving. If you're new to activity, try making your goal to be active during 1 commrecial. When you feel ready, make it for 2 commercials. Keep it up until you're being activity during every commercial.</li><br>

        <font color="3F3F3F">How do I use the recipes?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        Use the recipes as a guide to help you make healthy choices. Many recipes can be included in a balanced food plan, so get creative. The best way to learn to cook...is to cook! Include kids in the fun to help them learn how to be healthy. It can sometimes take a little longer with kids in the kitchen, but the more they practice cooking, the easier it gets for them too.</font>

        <font color="3F3F3F">What happens if I can't find my exact plate?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        That’s ok, the goal of tracking what your plate looks like is to help you make balanced choices. Find the closest looking plate to your meal you can find. Eating a mixed dish out and not sure what it looks like? Check out “Plate Examples” for some help. If you can't tell, make an educated guess. The more you track different foods, the easier it gets to recognize what plate a food or meal looks like.'</font>

        <font color="3F3F3F">I don't see my activity</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        That’s ok. Choose the closest activity you can find, or choose “Movement.” The goal of tracking activities is to encourage you to be active throughout the day, whatever your activity of choice is.</font>

        <font color="3F3F3F">Why can't I track my weight?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        Weight is a very small part of a healthy body and healthy life. In fact, many people who are considered an unhealthy weight are actually very healthy, and many people who are considered to be a normal weight have chronic health issues. By just focusing on weight, we often miss what’s really important for our life, health, and happiness. Weight loss can be a good motivator, but often we want to lose weight so we can love ourselves and our bodies. That often starts us on a cycle of being happy with ourselves and not being happy with ourselves. Instead of losing weight to be happy with ourselves, we should be making changes BECAUSE we are happy with ourselves. Any successful health and wellness, or weight loss program, focus on the mental and emotional side as well. If you find you're starting this without being truly happy with yourself, take some time every day for positive self affirmations. Stand in the mirror and tell yourself every day one thing you love about yourself. And remember, no matter what your weight or your clothing size, you are perfect just the way you are.</font>

        <font color="3F3F3F">How much movement should I be getting?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        Remember to always consult with a physician before starting any exercise routine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend for the average adult:
        <li>150 minutes of moderate activity (like brisk walking) a week PLUS muscle strengthening activities that strengthen all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms) at least 2 times a week.
            OR</li><br>
        <li>75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity (like jogging or running) a week PLUS muscle strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).
            OR</li><br>
        <li>An equivalent mix of moderate and vigorous activity PLUS muscle strengthening activities on 2 or more days a week that work all major muscle groups (legs, hips, back, abdomen, chest, shoulders, and arms).
        <li>The CDC recommends that older adults get more activity than this.</li> </font>

    <br><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="4"><br>
        <font color="3F3F3F">What counts as moderate activity?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        Moderate activity is any activity that gets your heart rate up. You should be able to hold on a conversation, but unable to sing a song. Moderate activities include: walking fast, water aerobics, pushing a lawn mower.</font>
    </font></font></font>
    
    <br><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="4"><br>
        <font color="3F3F3F">What counts as vigorous activity?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        Vigorous activity is any activity that gets your heart rate up more than moderate activity. You should not be able to carry on a conversation, or, it should be very difficult. Vigorous activities include:j ogging or running, swimming laps, playing basketball.</font>
    </font></font></font>
    
    <br><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="4"><br>
        <font color="3F3F3F">What counts as strength-building activities?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        Lifting weights, using resistance bands, doing exercises that use your bodyweight for resistance like push-ups, sit-ups, heavy gardening, and yoga.</font>
    </font></font></font>
    
    <br><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="4"><br>
        <font color="3F3F3F">What about interval training?</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        Interval training is a mixture of low-intensity and moderate/vigorous intensity activity. The idea behind interval training is it keeps your body and heart guessing, so you get a more intense workout in less time. Including interval training is a good way to increase your endurance. If you’re trying to start jogging, including intervals of jogging and walking can help you improve your jogging. </font>

    <br><font style="font-weight: bold;" size="4"><br>
        <font color="3F3F3F">Remember: it's ok to start small!</font></font>
    
    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
        Make goals for yourself that work for your life and that you can attain. Make sure the goal is important to YOU and YOU believe you can reach it.! Don't worry or get discouraged if you don't reach it. It's always ok to set a new goal for yourself. The goal of this program is to help you be able to not only reach goals, but to adapt goals to meet your life. Try setting smaller goals to help you focus on making small, sustainable changes. Even starting with dong 1 minute a day of some type of activity is a great goal, it might not seem like much, but that's 1 more minutes a week than you were doing before. Remember, life can change, and so can your goals.</font>
