            <p>Ergonomics is a topic we don't always associate with our overall health and wellbeing. But the way we sit, hold our phone and even type can affect our entire bodies. Hunching over or sitting at an angle can cause neck, back, shoulder, hip and leg pain, it can also lead to digestive problems. Not having proper lighting means we can strain our eyes, causing headaches. Don't sit with your knees at a 90 degree angle? You could be causing knee damage. Check out the resource below for ways to make your office space more ergonomically friendly. And unwind after a long day with yoga. Yoga helps stretch out all your muscles and realign your back, leading to you feeling much better. Just 5 minutes a night is enough to improve your flexibility. And having good flexibility is one of the most important things we can have as we get older.</p>
