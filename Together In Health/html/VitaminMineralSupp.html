        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Nutrition Supplements; with all those commercials and advertisements out there for them, it can be pretty taxing. Do you need them? How do you know which ones are safe? It is true that many adults are not getting the recommended amount of vitamins and minerals...but most Americans are also not eating a healthy balanced diet. If you're a healthy adult and eating a healthy, balanced diet, supplements can be more harmful than helpful. Supplements haven't really shown to help improve health or prevent chronic disease. You're much better off getting all the nutrients you need from food. If you do choose to take a Nutrition Supplement, make sure it has "USP" on the label. USP is a third-party that tests the safety and quality of dietary supplements, so you know you're getting what you're paying for. Supplement manufacturers do not need to submit evidence of safety or effectiveness to the FDA. They also do not need to get approval from the FDA before their supplements are put on the market. The FDA is in charge of pulling supplements from the market if they are found to be unsafe, but only after adverse events have happened. </font>

        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Focus on fiber. Most Americans don't get the recommended amount of fiber, and now with so many supplements and fiber bars and cereals out there, it's hard to know how to get a good product. Skip the bars and cereals, they are full of ingredients your body doesn't need, and stick to whole foods, focusing on vegetables and whole grains, to meet your daily fiber needs.</font>
