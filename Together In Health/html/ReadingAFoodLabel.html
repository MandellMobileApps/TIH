            <div style="text-align: left;"><font color="3F3F3F">Why you should ALWAYS look at the nutrition label</font></font>
        
        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">With the continuing increase in processed and packaged food, it can be hard to know what foods are better than others. Many foods claim that they pack a whole lot of health benefits in them, but do they really? Many foods claim to be good for you, but they can often times do your body more harm than good. Look past the flashy packaging and "eat me for health" labels and look at the only important labels - the nutrition facts label and ingredient statement.<br>

        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
            1. Look at the ingredients list. The easiest way to limit highly processed foods is to choose foods with less than 5 total ingredients. Sugar should not be in the first 3 ingredients.<br>
            <br>2. Start with the serving size. The calories might not seem like a lot, but if you're planning on eating more than 1 serving, it can add up.<br>
            <br>3. Look at the sugar content. Too much sugar can cause damage to our body and increase the risk of chronic health issues. <br>
            <br>4. Look at the saturated and trans fat. Because total fat in a product is made up of "essential, healthy, fats" and "unhealthy" fats, try to minimize intake of saturated and trans fat.

        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
            You should be able to pronounce everything in the food you're eating. If you can't pronounce it, chances are it was made in a lab. If the food product tastes sweet but has less than 5 grams of sugar in a serving, it might have artificial sweetners. If it tastes sweet, limit it, too much of real or artificial sugars can be harmful.</font>

            Real foods - foods that came from the ground, a plant, a tree or an animal don't need a nutrition facts label. Make most of your food choices foods without a label.</font>

            <font color="3F3F3F">What about cholesterol?</font></font>
        
        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
            It was originally throught that cholesterol in food raised cholesterol in the body. Many studies have now shown that the cholesterol in food has very little, if any, effect on the cholesterol in the body. The human body makes cholesterol from carbohydrates, it especially likes to make cholesterol out of sugary foods, even from natural sugars. The more carbohydrates and sugar the body has, the more cholesterol it can make. Many foods that contain cholesterol offer a variety of important nutrients.</font>

            <font color="3F3F3F">What do those allergen statements mean?</font></font>
        
        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
            A food manufacturer that makes a food that is required to have a nutrition label has to declare if the food has any of the 8 major allergens: </font>
        </font></font></font>
        
        <br>
        
        <font style="font-weight: bold;" size="4"><br>
            <font color="3F3F3F">Vitamins and minerals</font></font>
        
        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">
            Food labels must contain the percent Daily Value (%DV) of 4 nutrients:
            <br><li>Vitamin A</li>
            <li>Vitamin C</li>
            <li>Calcium</li>
            <li>Iron</li><br>
            A food manufacturer can choose to list other vitamins and minerals if they choose. The amount of vitamins and minerals stated can be a combination of those naturally occuring in the product plus any that have been added by the manufacturer. It often times seems like an easy way to include more nutrients in a diet, but it's important to remember that those nutrients that have been added were made in a lab, meaning that while they are very close to their natural counterparts, they are not exactly the same. We don't yet know the effect that artificial nutrients have on the human body. It is important for the body to get all the nutrients it needs, but the best way to make sure the body is getting everything it needs is from real food. Since all foods offer different nutrients, it's important to eat a variety of foods.
