        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">With the "low-fat" and "no-carb" crazes out there, we're left with only one more macronutrient to focus on - protein. But what is a protein? Why do we need it? And how much do we really need? Protein provides the same calories in the diet as carbohydrates (4 calories/gram of food), it's the building blocks of our muscles and organs and is essential for proper healing. Protein is also really important to keep us feeling full and energized throughout the day. Most people should be getting around 1gram of protein for every kilogram of body weight (to get this, divide your weight by 2.2), which is roughly the amount you'll get if you focus on balancing your meals and having appropriate portion sizes. Too much protein can cause problems for our kidneys, especially when we don't eat enough carbs. Without a balanced meal our body makes a chemical called ketones, and ketones damage the body. So make sure you're getting your protein, your carbs, and your veggies to keep your body fueled and happy. Individuals who weight train don't need much more added protein in their diet. This is because weight training does not burn many calories, and uses carbohydrates as an energy source, it doesn't really break down any muscle. Long distance runners and endurance athletes need more protein because with all that physical activity they actually break down muscle, and need the extra protein to rebuild it.
