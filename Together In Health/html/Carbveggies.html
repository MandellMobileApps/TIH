        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">There are many different types of vegetables, some grow on bushes, some grow in the ground, and some grow as a stalk. So how do we decide if a vegetable really is a vegetable? After all, tomatoes are botanically a fruit but we eat them as vegetables. So how should vegetables be classified? My colleagues and I classify a vegetable as a vegetable depending on its calorie and carbohydrate content. If a vegetable has carbohydrates and calories that are close to bread then it's a carbohydrate, if it's closer to spinach or broccoli, we count it as a vegetable. This helps make sure our patients are getting all the vitamins, minerals and antioxidants they need without including extra calories and carbohydrates in their diets. Research consistently shows that many people, especially children, get most of their "vegetables" as potatoes. While potatoes do have vitamin C and fiber, they are also equal to rice and bread in terms of their calorie and carbohydrate content.
