        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">In the past decade, organic foods have been flooding the market, marketed as healthier than their conventional counterparts, and often at a much steeper price. So what is all the hype about organic about? Are they really healthier for you? In terms of nutrition content, organic and non-organic foods have, in general, the same nutritional content. Organic farmers are allowed to use pesticides, and in fact, they do. The difference between organic and non-organic is not the use of pesticides, it is where the pesticides come from, and organic foods must not contain any GMOs. Organic pesticides have to come from a natural product, they can't be made in a lab. But just because it's natural, doesn't mean it's healthy or safe. The best way to ensure you're getting a safe product that was sustainably grown is to ask the farmer. Often times, organic food shipped from another country is actually worse for the environment than a non-organic local food. There are a lot of non-organic farmers in the US who aren't certified, so be a detective, and know what goes on your food before it gets to you. </font>
