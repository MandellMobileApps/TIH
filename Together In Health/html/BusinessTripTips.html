        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">1. If you are not currently on EST time and you're sensitive to time change (like me), slowly start going to bed earlier and waking up earlier to get closer to EST.
            
            2. Stay hydrated with water! Dehydration can drain our brains and bodies of their ability to function, and leave us with a not so fun headache.
            
            3. Go for a morning walk. This will help wake both your body and mind and boost your mood, It will also help you be awake, alert and enthusiastic.
            
            4. If you know you will be eating out most of the time and you plan on partaking in adult beverages, have a B-complex with electrolytes, B-vitamins and antioxidants. (I like Emergen-C, it's easy to pack and means you'll be getting an extra glass of water that day).</font>
