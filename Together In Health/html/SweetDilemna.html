        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Sugar, especially high-fructose corn syrup, has gotten quite a bad rap, and has been blamed for a lot of things, including the obesity epidemic. But is sugar really that bad for us? After all, humans have been consuming sugar in one form or another for centuries. In fact, we were introduced to sugar and its sweet taste from the moment we were born - one of the main components of breast milk is sugar! Sugar provided us with the energy we needed to grow up to be healthy and happy adults. But what about when we become those adults? Sugar has addictive qualities, meaning that it affects the part of the brain that makes us feel good, and usually, the more sugar we have, the more sugar we want. Food manufacturers use this mind-altering power of sugar to keep us going back for their products...even products they mark as "healthy." Think of all those protein drinks, fiber bars, and sweetened probiotic containing yogurts. You're much better off getting your protein from a real protein source, like chicken, your fiber from real food, like vegetables and whole grains, and your probiotics from fermented products that don't contain all that sugar. High-fructose corn syrup has about the same amount of fructose as honey and fruit. Our bodies can't really distinguish the difference, too much of anything, even "natural" sugars is a bad thing. </font>

        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4"> If you find you can never stop at just one piece of chocolate, or one cooking, you might need to cut sugar completely out of your diet for at least 72 hours. The longer you go without sugar, the less your body will want it. You might find you need to avoid all sweet foods, including fruit. Any sugary food that you always go for more of are trigger foods, and the only way to get rid of those sugar cravings is to give up sugar, even artificial sugar. Just a small amount of sugar (artificial or natural) in your morning coffee sets your body up to want sugar and sugary foods for the rest of the day. </p></font>
