        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">I get asked all the time "what can I eat for breakfast?" In America, we've come to think of breakfast as a specific food category, and that we have to choose our breakfast from that category. The truth is...breakfast is simply the name of a time we eat, it is not a food category. In fact, breakfast food should, in a lot of cases, be eaten just as a dessert and only on occasion. So what can we have for breakfast then? Anything that fits into a balanced and healthy plate. Try some grilled cheese with tomato and avocado, or a ham and cheese quesadilla with salsa, or even left-overs from the night before. I also get asked if breakfast really is important. It is. It can be hard to get in a good breakfast if you don't have much time or much of an appetite in the morning. Eating a balanced breakfast helps set you, your body, and your mind up for the rest of the day. When your mornings are hectic, make sure you plan ahead, you can even prepare breakfast the night before. As lifestyles in America have moved from a more agricultural setting to a more urban setting, and our hours have been measured by a clock instead of the sun, we've grown more and more accustomed to eating certain meals at certain times of the day, and with this has come meal categories, like breakfast cereal for breakfast.

        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Try to get in a healthy and balanced breakfast most of the days this week. If you need something on the go, make yourself a breakfast burrito (you can prep the filling the night before, in the morning just wrap it up in a tortilla and go). It doesn't have to be a big sit-down breakfast, even a snack will do.</font>
