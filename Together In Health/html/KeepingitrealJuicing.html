        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Juicing and smoothies, do they really pack the healthy benefits their manufacturers claim they do? There is no evidence showing that juicing or smoothies improve health. Most juices and smoothies have a lot of sugar in them. And unfortunately, there is no real difference between all natural fruit sugar and table sugar in terms of health. What if you juice at home? If you're juicing fruit, you're getting all that sugar without any of the benefits of fiber. It's true that fruit offers vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants, but it also offers a lot of sugar and a lot of calories. It's much better to stick to the real thing, and to load up on vegetables as the main source of your nutrients (note that peas, corn, potatoes, beans and squash that aren't green, count as a carbohydrate, not a vegetable). The recommendation for fruit for the average adult is (no more than) two servings - a serving is 1 cup fruit or fruit the size of a tennis ball.
            
            Recommendations for added sugar: no more than 20g per day.
            As a clinical nutritionist, I count juice (even 100% fruit juice) as an added sugar. Without the health benefits of that fiber, it becomes a straight shot of sugar to your blood.  </font>

        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Stick to the real thing. Those fruit and vegetables can be fresh, frozen, even canned. You can eat them raw or cooked. Have some fun with it. If you do have a juice or smoothie, check the calories and the sugar. Choose a low-sugar option, and use it as a snack or meal replacement, not as your drink for that snack or meal. Make sure you check out the number of servings - a lot of juices and smoothies have 2 servings per container.</font>
