        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Are fresh fruits and vegetables really healthier for you than canned or frozen? We always here we should eat more fresh fruits and vegetables. But the truth is, canned and frozen fruits and vegetables offer all the same nutrition as their fresh counterparts, and they offer a much longer shelf-life. I always have a frozen vegetable medley on hand for when I don't have time to cut up all those fresh vegetables. I love using canned vegetables in my stews, because they're quick, easy, and cheap. "Fresh" produce can sit on a farm, in a truck, and at the grocery for quite awhile before you buy it and eat it. The best way to ensure you are getting the freshest produce is to get to know your farmer. Try farmer's markets and CSA (community supported agriculture) to ensure your produce really is fresh.</font>
