        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">I often have people hang their heads and tell me "I know I shouldn't be" when they tell me they drink coffee. Coffee seems to be a very controversial beverage, so what is the truth behind that little black bean? Coffee contains very beneficial antioxidants, but like most things, more isn't always better. Studies have shown that antioxidants are really good for us, but they're also finding that more doesn't necessarily protect us, and in fact, can be harmful. So stick to just a cup or two a day and you'll be getting all the good stuff without going overboard. It's important to remember that coffee acts as "fake energy." Coffee doesn't really give you energy, it makes your body think it has energy that it really doesn't. If you're consuming more than 2 cups of coffee a day, you're probably not getting good sleep. And like any other "disease-fighting" and "chronic disease preventing" substance, coffee by itself is not enough to replace an unhealthy and unbalanced diet. Individuals who ate diets high in meat and dairy and low in fruits and vegetables had no real health benefits from coffee or tea. So stick to real, whole, balanced foods and enjoy coffee and/or tea as a warm (or cold and refreshing) beverage. Caffeine is the most widely consumed drug worldwide. Caffeine is considered a drug because it stimulates the central nervous system.

        <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Go ahead and enjoy that cup of morning coffee or afternoon pick-me up tea, but remember moderation. If you find you need more than 2 cups of coffee or tea (8 oz cups) a day, you probably should be getting more sleep, so focus on how to get those solid 6-8 hours of snoozing per night.</font>
