    <font color="3F3F3F"><br><font size="4">Just focusing on counting calories, points, carbohydrates, has been shown to not work for long-term success. Together In Health lets you track and see your progress using colors. Balanced eating, and a balanced life, is the key to being healthy and successful. We focus on balancing meals and snacks. </font>

        Together In Health is not a weight loss program. It doesn't require counting points or counting calories. Why not? Weight loss programs focus on only one very small aspect of health - weight. Together In Health focuses on body, mind and soul. It takes your life, your experiences, your goals all into account. It works with you and your body to help you be healthy from the inside out. It takes into account the latest science from around the world, and what people have known for centuries. And most importantly - your happiness is the real top priority. The best way to start any health program is to love yourself first. Most people find that even after they lose the weight, reach their weight goal, they still don't love themselves fully. That's because we've been taught for a long time that our worth is tied to a number, whether it's a number on a scale or a pants size. We all have the power to take control of our lives and make it what we want, but to be truly successful, we have to love ourselves first.</font>
